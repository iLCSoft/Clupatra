  --------
 | v00-10 |
  --------
    - bug fix: remove sqrt from computation of r_phi_res^2 for finding best hit
    - included multi-module TPC support via GEAR interface
    - ignore hits that are outside of the TPC range (possible in data)
    - added new processor FixCellIDs_Error_TestBeam (based on the original FixCellIDs)
       that sets the correct hit CellIDs and hit uncertainties for test beam data
    - added examples for test beam data. Look at examples/README for more details



------------------------------------------------------------
 

- current version of algorithm ( May, 2012)

   ClupatraProcessor.cc

 - fill histos for track finding efficiencies
   TrackEfficiency.cc
  
 - update cellIDs in plder file:      
   FixCellIDs.cc

 =============================================================================================================

  -----------
 | v00-09-01 |
  -----------

    - in TrackCircleDistance::operator()():
      adapted to fix in KalTest where curler segments
      now have correct Z0 (typically close to the IP)
      - do not merge segements if the z-positions of
        both their first hits is within 20 mm of the
        IP

    - changed  LCIOTrackConverter::operator() to use the
      first constrained fit ( ~= 3rd hit) smoothed to extrapolate
      back to the calorimeter

    - fixed issue in ClupatraProcessor::check() when no 
      TPCTrackerHits are present ( using LCIterator ) 
 
    - moved local LCIterator to LCIO as UTIL::LCIterator
      use this in all processors

    - updated to use new PlanarDigiProcessor 
      (was: SimplePlanarTestDigiprocessor )

    - fixed coverity issues: mostly unitialized c'tor, some unchecked dynamic_casts and division by zero (nhit++)

    - deactivate pick'n save feature 
      (#define WRITE_PICKED_DEBUG_TRACKS false)

  --------
 | v00-09 |
  --------

     - apply a refit with larger maximum chi2 increment to tracks that have only
       a small number of hits used (IMarlinTrkFitter::operator())

     - drop poor seed clusters with no hits added except in the very forward (inner) region

     - clupatra_new: added optional  argument TrkSystem* to addHitsAndFilter();
       if given, the smoothed TrackState is used for backward extrapolation;
       => not currently used, i.e. the last filtered  TrackStae is used
       ( this should give better results than the previous version that
         used the filtered TrackState at the 4th hit )    

     - don't set quality bit on tracker hit: ILDTrkHitQualityBit::USED_IN_FIT anymore,
       as this won't work on pre-digitized files (and is not unique wrt other pat rec code)

     - added DebugDigiProcessor :
       takes TrackerHits from a collection of Tracks (e.g. previously written 
       as ClupatraPoorTrackCollection ) and writes them into new Collections
       ( according to subdetID )
       -> see ./example/clupa_debug.xml

    -  added debug method printAndSaveTrack() to Clupatra:
       allows to store a collection of Tracks selected through picking in CED
 
    -  added doxygen documentation of parameters in ClupatraProcessor.h

    -  Updated for new lcio TrackState copy constructor taking const reference.

  --------
 | v00-08 |
  --------
    - changed order of hits in track and hits in fit
      in subdetector hit numbers

    - changed way how curler tracks are written out:
       - store only complete track segments - as used in the fit
       - for merged curlers only the primary segment (closest to IP)
         is stored in track output collection where
         the other segments are referenced through the track pointers
         (sorted in z) 

    - no change in algorithm 


  -----------
 | v00-07-01 |
  -----------

   - set radius of innermost hits in Tracks
 

  --------
 | v00-07 |
  --------

    - added code to merge split tracks seeds - this happens sometimes if one link of a track seed
      is just a bit further than the current distance cut ( artefact of loops with increasing 
      distance cuts )

    - introduced parameter CosAlphaCut and merge hits from consecutive rows if
      their angle is smaller than acos(CosAlphaCut)
      -> helps to recover some stiff tracks in forward region   

    - added parameter NLoopForSeeding (default 4 )
      defining the number of loops for seeding with different distance cuts 

    - restrict segment merging to two segments at a time in order to
      prevent falsly merging almost complete tracks (through a small 'common' stub)
      - repeat this procedure once in order to get also tracks split into three 

    - use track state at first hit also for outward extrapolation as this is more 
      accurate when merging segments

  --------
 | v00-06 |
  --------

    - added new TrackSegmentMerger for merging split tracks

    - add ppointer to original track segments for
      merged curling tracks 

    - added parameter SegmentCollectionName

    - added steering parameters TrackStartsInnerDist, TrackEndsOuterCentralDist,
      TrackEndsOuterForwardDist, TrackIsCurlerOmega  to define "incomplete" track segments

    - adapted pickupSiTracks to use strip hits for the SIT

    - fixed issue w/ split seed tracks (occured, e.g. if hit distance is larger than current
      cut in the loop for one hit pair ...)

    - made compatible with llvmgcc4.2 and clang 


  -----------
 | v00-05-01 |
  -----------
      - patch release: bug fix: protect against tracks w/o TS at firat/last hit

   --------
 | v00-05 |
  --------

      - reduce memory footprint: deal with one KalTest track at a time wherever possible
        (saves >2MByte/track)

      - properly set the bit UTIL::ILDTrkHitQualityBit::USED_IN_FIT
        for all trackerhits used in fit

      - set correct subdetectorHitNumbers() for used in fit
         ( trk->subdetectorHitNumbers()[ 2*lcio::ILDDetID::TPC - 1 ] =  usedInFIt ; 
           trk->subdetectorHitNumbers()[ 2*lcio::ILDDetID::TPC - 2 ] =  nHit ;  )

      - algorithmic improvements:
          - introduce a loop over increasing distance cuts for finding the tracks seeds
             -> fixdes some of the problems seen @ 3 TeV with extremely boosted jets

          - use function split_multiplicity() to split up merged cluster seeds if possible
             ( improves efficiencies in forward region )

           - added create_n_clusters and use for splitting up 
            clusters with multiplicities 4 and 5 

      - added gear and steering file for CLIC detector

      - added some debugging functionality
        - new track debugging processor - under developmet: TrackCheckMCTruth
        - added debug method printTrackerHit() for picking 
        - added optional debug collections:
          ClupatraPoorQualityTracks, ClupatraOuterSegments, ClupatraInnerSegments, ClupatraMiddleSegments
	  
       - improved TrackEfficiencyProcessor
           - extended pt range to 500 GeV 
           - introduce cut on good hit fraction (96%)
             (needs MarlinReco v01-01 )

 -----------
 | v00-04-01 |
  -----------

     - fixed (small) memory leak in src/ClupatraProcessor.cc

  --------
 | v00-04 |
  --------
    - src/ClupatraProcessor.cc: - improved re-clustering:
      - now also loop in (larger) pad row range
      - increase maxdeltaChi2
    - src/FixCellIDs.cc: - reduced verbosity level from WARNING to
      DEBUG5 for missing collections

  --------
 | v00-03 |
  -------- 
     - write out canonical track states: AtIP, AtFirst/LastHit, AtCalorimeter

     - made hard coded parameters into processor parameters:
	  MaxDeltaChi2, Chi2Cut, MaxStepWithoutHit, PadRowRange,
	  MinLayerFractionWithMultiplicity, MinLayerNumberWithMultiplicity

     - added optional picking up of Si-hits (experiemtal)
      
     - add subdetectorHitNumbers:
	  2*ILDDetID::TPC-1 : hitsinFit
	  2*ILDDetID::TPC-2 : hitsinTrack
	  
    - cleaned up code and removed obsolete processors
   


  --------
 | v00-02 |
  -------- 
      - NNClusterer.h : re-factoring of NNCluster code
         - clearer type definitions 
         - use Element and Cluster (as oposed to GenericHits/GenericClusters)
         - clearer memory management
            - classes PtrVector and PtrList: user defines ownership
         - introduced NNClusterer class to collect cluster functions and
          conveneient typedefs

      - clupatra_new.cc :   re-factoring of clupatra helper code
          using new NNClusterer      

      - rewrote ClupatraProcessor to use clupatra_new and NNClusterer and
        MarlinTrk package
         => KalTest/KalTrack and KalDet like classes no longer needed

      - old classs and code still left for comparisons ....
